# What is GIT?

###### I like to say that it is like a super power of a developer or programmer. It is a **version control software**, its purpose is to keep track of changes in computer files (local level) and coordinate the work that several people do on shared files (You can also work alone, no problem). Now if you want to work remotely for that there is GitHub.
