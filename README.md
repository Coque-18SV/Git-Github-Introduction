# What is GIT?

##### I like to say that it is like a super power of a developer or programmer. It is a **version control software**, its purpose is to keep track of changes in computer files (local level) and coordinate the work that several people do on shared files (You can also work alone, no problem). Now if you want to work remotely for that there is GitHub.

##### Click here to [Install Git](https://git-scm.com).

# What is GITHUB?

##### It is a collaborative development platform or as I like to say it; "The social network of a programmer" that is used to host projects (in the cloud) using the Git version control system. It also has a very useful tool that is GitHub Pages where we can publish our static projects (HTML, CSS and JS or other types of projects) for free.
